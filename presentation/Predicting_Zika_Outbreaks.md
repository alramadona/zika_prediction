# Outbreak Overview

* Isolated in monkeys of Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947
* Current outbreak has infected ~1.5 M in Brazil alone
* Causes microcephaly in children born to women infected during pregnancy
* Rare cases of Guillian-Barré syndrome in adults/children
* Currently no vaccine available

^ zoonotic virus identified several decades ago, outbreak in central and south america, causes birth defects

---

# Motivation

1. Ending preventable birth defects and disease-related suffering
2. Minimize financial burden on governments and health care systems

# Motivation

1. Ending preventable birth defects and disease-related suffering
2. Minimize financial burden on governments and health care systems

## **Goal: Predict Zika outbreaks before they happen to provide advanced warning for those at risk**

^ Reducing human suffering

# Transmission

* Transmitted by bodily fluids and *Aedes aegypti* mosquito
* Vector for yellow fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya
* Two week lifespan, prefers tropical climates

^ Understanding transmission is a key component of predicting Zika outbreaks. Rare cases of transmission by *Aedes albopictus* also exist

# Data and Methods [^1]

![left, 110%](data_sources.png)

* Unique location ID constructed from Zika data for merging via SQL
* Merging also facilitated by scraping latitude and longitude 
* Outbreak regions classified by date of first reported case
* Best performing model from AdaBoost ± ADASYN upsampling

^ RED boxes: date and location, BLUE boxes: location, best params: temperature, rain, population density, gdp

# Results

![inline 200%](model_stats.png)

^ Focused on recall, but upsampled model had better precision, albeit at the expense of recall

---

# Outbreak Timeline and Predictions

---

# Conclusions

* Zika outbreaks can be predicted with extremely high degree of recall (98%) using machine learning
* Incorporation of ensembling or additional model features could further improve precision
* Additional testing of model temporal specificity needed

---

# Thank You

## Any questions?

---

# Backup Slides

---

# Future Work

* Incorporate additional data and more sophisticated feature engineering into model
* Compare ensemble models to AdaBoost
* Rigorously test the temporal specificity of scenario modeling
* Changes in class imbalance change over time?

# Methodology

* Average weekly weather (temp, rain, wind) was scraped for two weeks before the date of each report
* Incoming flights from infected countries were determined on a rolling basis by date—-like cellular automaton
* Inverse sum used for proximity to positive mosquito identification locations
